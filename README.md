# MA615-Final-Project

Here is my published shiny app:
https://shixinliang.shinyapps.io/lasttest/ 

It is not my full shiny app. I can run the code on my computer and get a full shiny app. However, when I published my shiny app, some plots can not be shown. 
To see my full shiny app, could you please use the code and data in the file: Final Project Shiny.zip.   
    
In addition, to run the codes, the compressed reviews dataset should be decompressed.  
    
Thank you!!
